> LGthree is a web application that provides information about the airports located inside the Greek F.I.R. along with useful tools to be used by the pilots and/or the Air Traffic Controllers.

The application was developed as a part of my thesis titled "*Introduction to Laravel PHP Framework and development of a web application that provides information about Greek airports using Laravel and Vue.js*". Relevant files can be found [here](./thesis/thesis_slides.pdf) and [here](./thesis/thesis_text.pdf) (in Greek)

LGthree provides info about aiports such as names, coordinates, runways e.t.c. Also the application has some useful tools such as the real-time calculation of the active runway based on the current weather conditions.

The application also has a fully-working administration panel to update airports information.
