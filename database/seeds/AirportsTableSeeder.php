In 1958 the runway 10/28 got reconstructed and extended to a total length of 2,440m (current length), while runway 16/34 was extended to 2,400m, with its completion in 1972.

Due to the earthquake of 1978 in Thessaloniki, the control tower was destroyed, so a new one was constructed, independent of the main terminal building. The next expansion of the terminal took place in two stages, with the projects starting in 1991 and 1993 respectively. The municipality of Thessaloniki, as European Capital of Culture for 1997, took over a projects for the aesthetic intervention, renovation, modernisation and reorganisation of the spaces of the building.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">The terminal building took its current form, when an additional of 19,000mÂ² were added to the western and eastern side of the terminal building, completed in November 2000 and June 2003 respectively. The western extension included the widening of the international departures area (new Extra-Schengen area ), including new administration offices, a new health station and the new station control of Olympic Airlines. The eastern expansion included a new check-in hall, new waiting halls and additional administrative offices for airlines. Today the terminal has a total floor area of 32,000mÂ². Finally, during 2004â2006 the new motorway junction was completed on the level of the departures entrance of the Terminal and new parking spaces for cars, buses and taxis were created.</p>', 'procedures' => '<ul><li>Terrain & turbulence.</li><li>Approach rwy 34 low over sloping terrain, steep approach 3.3 degrees & steep PAPIâs at 3.8 degrees.</li><li>Runway 10/28 closed due WIP (work in progress)</li></ul><p class="text-justify">A 500 ft contour line lies only 1.5 nm south of the airfield and numerous obstructions within the circling area.

There can be quite a difference between the two readings. Local experience suggests that a touchdown wind of 340Â°-360Â° will give little turbulence on RWY 09 approach, but excessive turbulence on RWY 27 approach. Under these conditions landing on RWY 09 with a tailwind component is preferable.</p><h5>DESCENT</h5><p class="text-justify">Inbound routing from the west is usually via ORMOS to SAM VOR.

Because of the relatively low altitude, communication problems with Athens and Samos are common both inbound and outbound, so use of the squelch button, if fitted, may be required.

When visual follow the guidance depicted on the Visual Manoeuvring chart (see picture). Due to high close-in terrain (RWY 09) and Turkish airspace (RWY 27) a close-in curved approach is required, turning final at approximately 1-2 nms.</p><p class="text-justify">CAUTION: With southerly winds, commence turn onto finals slightly before reaching published turning point/radial to avoid over-bank requirement.</p><h5>VISUAL MANOEUVRE TO LAND â RWY 09</h5><p class="text-justify">At D4.0 SAM select landing flap, commence descent from 1850 ft and track approximately 325Â° towards the coast-line.

A GPWS warning is possible when crossing the ridge.</p><p class="text-justify">The runway is grey tarmac and the white touchdown markings may be more visible than the runway itself when on the initial base leg. Turning final an abbreviated 2 box VASI should be seen. The upwind VASI box is abeam the 1000 ft touchdown markings, and the downwind box abeam the 500 ft markings. Consequently a normal approach to touchdown 1000ft beyond the displaced threshold will show white/white on the VASIS during the final stages of the approach. RWY 09 may appear shorter than it actually is.</p><h5>VISUAL MANOEUVRE TO LAND â RWY 27</h5><p class="text-justify">At D4.0 SAM select landing flap, commence descent from 1850 ft and track approximately 040Â°. At approx 120Â° R SAM commence left turn to final. Aim to cross 120Â° R SAM at 900 ft. Cross the eastern end of the pier on the extended centreline at 400 ft. Do not overshoot the extended centreline. Avoid Turkish airspace by establishing on a left base no further E than the midpoint of the channel separating the island from mainland Turkey.</p><h5>BAULKED LANDING GUIDANCE â RWY 09/27</h5><p class="text-justify">If it is necessary to discontinue the approach after passing D4.0 SAM inbound it is recommended to continue initially towards the runway and then turn to establish on the 161Â° radial outbound. At a safe height return to SAM holding. Advise ATC.</p><h5>GO AROUND RWY 09</h5><p class="text-justify">During strong northerly winds expect severe turbulence on initial climbout, just east of the runway end, due to rotor effects.</p><h5>RUNWAY AND AIRPORT FACILITIES</h5><p class="text-justify">The runway surface is uneven. ASU/GPU and toilet servicing available. Follow instructions from ATC carefully with regard to entering and leaving the apron to avoid jet blast of terminal.

Landings may only be performed by captains, so if a captain is taken ill on an inbound flight, then it must be diverted to an alternative airport (usually Volos/Nea Anchialos Airport which is the closest facility to accept passenger flights). Additionally, the runway down-slope on runway 20 leads to an illusion of a shorter runway as the southern end cannot be seen when close to the ground. When flights approach runway 02 from the south, the flight path is to the east of Skiathos town and over a coastal road just outside the airport boundary. Due to this, it is a very popular runway to watch flights landing and taking off at close quarters. Many videos have been uploaded to YouTube of this. Skiathos has often been dubbed "the Greek Sint Maarten" (referring to a similar airport on the island of Sint Maarten).</p> <p style="text-justify">Some flights departing Skiathos for British airports cannot take sufficient fuel to complete the trip without stopping at an intermediate airport to refuel, due to the limiting length of the runways. Aircraft such as the Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737 typically stop at Thessaloniki International Airport to refuel. The B757-200s, however, are usually able to carry sufficient fuel to operate directly to British destinations, such as London Gatwick. On one occasion, Air Italy used a Boeing 767â200 on the flight from Milan, making this the largest aircraft to have used the airport. The longest route operating to Skiathos is operated by Thomas Cook Airlines to Newcastle. The route was operated non-stop by the Boeing 757-200 until Summer 2014 when it will be replaced by a brand new Airbus A321, necessitating a stop in Kavala on the return. Thus, the current longest non stop flight to Skiathos operates to Manchester and is operated by Thomas Cook Airlines, Monarch Airlines and Thomson Airways, both on the Boeing 757-200.</p> <p style="text-justify">Skiathos only has one terminal and no jetways and has the capacity for only two parked aircraft at any one time.</p>','vfr_overview'=>'<p class="text-justify">1.

This was then merely a piece of flat agricultural land. The first aeroplane (a Junkers Ju-52) carried the first passengers to the site. During the Second World War operations ceased, but in fall 1946 traffic re-assumed, introducing the DC-3 aircraft.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">At first, the airport only offered very basic service, with only primitive installations on the site, in the form of three tents, smoke for wind determination and storm lamps for runway lighting.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">In 1947, the first (small) terminal was erected. Hellenic Airlines started commercial flights in 1948. At that time, a total of 4,000 people were served. The year 1953 saw the construction of a paved runway which was initially 1,850 meters long and oriented as 09/27. The next major event followed in 1954, when a four-engined DC-4 aircraft landed for the first time at the airport. In that year the airport handled approximately 18.000 passengers. From 1957 onward, the new Olympic Airways used the airport, starting services with the DC-6 aircraft.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">From 1968 until 1971, the runway was extended to 2,680 meters and a new terminal and other facilities were constructed, essentially making it a new airport. On March 18, 1971, the first charter flight from abroad (British Airways) operated at the airport. The new airport itself was officially inaugurated on May 5, 1972.</p> <p style="text-align:justify">During the summer months the airport can become very congested. During this period it is not uncommon that passengers have to wait in queue for check-in outside the terminal. Therefore, a new airport at Kastelli Pediados has been planned. The project is originally expected to be completed by 2015. The cost of this airport will be approximately 1 billion euros.
